How to run gcov to get coverage information:

(Assume filename is "example1.cpp")

1: 	Run the following command to compile .cpp:
	
		g++ -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -fPIC -O0 [cpp_filename] -o [executable_filename]

		e.g.
		g++ -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -fPIC -O0 example1.cpp -o example1

	You will get "example1" and "example1.gcno" after this step. 


2:	Run the executable file "example1":

		./example1

	You will get "example1.gcda" after this step. 


3. 	Run gcov command to get the coverage information:
	
		gcov [executable_filename]

		e.g.
		gcov example1 -i -r

	To get gcov help, type:

		gcov -h


4.	The coverage information is stored in .gcov file (e.g. example1.gcov).
